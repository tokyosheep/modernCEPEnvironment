 *
 * **For more details, please read this Redux docs page:**
 * **https://redux.js.org/introduction/why-rtk-is-redux-today**
 *
 * `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit is an improved version of `createStore` that
 * simplifies setup and helps avoid common bugs.
 *
 * You should not be using the `redux` core package by itself today, except for learning purposes.
 * The `createStore` method from the core `redux` package will not be removed, but we encourage
 * all users to migrate to using Redux Toolkit for all Redux code.
 *
 * If you want to use `createStore` without this visual deprecation warning, use
 * the `legacy_createStore` import instead:
 *
 * `import { legacy_createStore as createStore} from 'redux'`
